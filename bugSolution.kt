The solution lies in understanding the core difference and choosing the appropriate function based on the desired outcome. If you intend to modify the original collection, use `removeIf`. If you need a new collection without the elements matching the predicate, use `removeAll`. 

No code changes are needed in `bug.kt` to demonstrate the bug.  The comments explain the behavior.

If you want to ensure you always modify the original collection, always use `removeIf`. If you want to keep the original collection as is, clone it and use `removeAll` on the clone.

For example, to always remove items in place, use:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val list = mutableListOf<Int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    list.removeIf { it % 2 == 0 }
    println(list) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
}
```
